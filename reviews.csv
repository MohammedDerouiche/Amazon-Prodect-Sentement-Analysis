Has a super high response time and works great in many games.Games tested: Dead by DaylightSea of thievesHalo InfiniteResident evil 3 remake, 4 remake, and 8My only gripe or concern is that the palm rest is not attachable, and is a standalone rest.

"Candy","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on April 16, 2024","I love that I can customize the colors of the keyboard, and brightness. I was really just looking for a comfortable, quiet keyboard. It isn't the quietest but it's pretty close to completely silent. The feel of the keys are nice and smooth. Just hope it holds up!!

 As an avid gamer, I've always been on the lookout for a keyboard that can keep up with my fast-paced gaming sessions, and this keyboard delivers in every aspect. With its matte black finish and RGB backlighting, it instantly adds a touch of sophistication to my gaming setup. The keys are perfectly spaced and have just the right amount of resistance, making typing and gaming incredibly comfortable.One of my favorite features of this keyboard is the hybrid mechanical switches. They combine the tactile feedback of a mechanical switch with the soft cushioned feel of a membrane switch. This unique combination provides a satisfying typing experience without compromising on comfort.Another great feature is the fully programmable macro keys. With these customizable keys, I can assign complex actions or shortcuts to a single key press, giving me a competitive edge in games. It's incredibly convenient and has saved me countless keystrokes.If I had to nitpick, I would say that the Ornata V3 X could benefit from dedicated media controls. While it does have media function keys integrated into the top row, having dedicated buttons would make adjusting volume or skipping tracks easier during gameplay.Overall, I am very happy with my new keyboard and don't see myself replacing it anytime soon.

"Mark Z","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 11, 2024","Pros:• Nice, sleek design• Keys feel nice to type on (for membrane keys anyway) as in they have a pleasant feedback and the keys’ surface is pleasantly soft to the touch• The RGB backlighting can get super bright, which I am not used to. I like the option to change it. I’m not used to that option for a keyboard.• Worked right away with Windows 10 without Razer software• The cable routing option underneath the keyboard was an unexpected surprise. Nice touch Razer!Cons:• You apparently need the Razer Synapse software to change the RGB lighting, among other things.• That space bar is much louder compared to all the other keys, and you most definitely will notice it. (Very loud for a membrane keyboard anyway.)• The keys are a bit tough to see without any lighting on, but not too bad. (I am just used to the Logitech K120 keyboard’s highly visible keys.)• The lack of dedicated media buttons, but I knew that before purchase.• The Synapse software is fascinating, yet quite slow. It’s still interesting to use, but not a positive in my book for a keyboard. (Try the Synapse Beta software instead, as it seemed more responsive.)Main review:I am coming from using a typical, no-frills, cheap keyboard called the Logitech K120 that is quite popular and I have had no issues with. I just wanted to try something…new.This is my first gaming keyboard I tried since getting a Saitek Eclipse (series 1) with membrane keys back in 2008. I loved that Eclipse keyboard. I never had a gaming keyboard before that, and I just plugged the USB cable into my new desktop PC at the time and it worked. The Saitek Eclipse had dedicated/separate volume buttons and backlighting button on it other than using the function keys or something. The keys felt great and it never let me down for many years before I sold it for some reason. Also, I don’t recall needing to have downloaded some software unlike this Razer one to get the backlighting to work. No it didn’t have RGB lighting, but a keyboard with backlighting was amazing to me for a new desktop PC. Sure, this Razer keyboard works without downloading Razer’s Synapse software, but I wish there was a way to change the backlight color without it. That’s my main gripe about this Razer keyboard. I still haven’t tried the highly touted mechanical keyboards that I have been reading about for eons, but I have loved membrane keyboards so much that I haven’t felt the need to try mechanical yet. I may change my mind soon.This keyboard evokes a bit of the same feeling as that keyboard, although this Razer keyboard of course doesn’t have dedicate media buttons. Do I need those dedicated media buttons? Not really…but they sure came in handy and I knew where they were and were easily accessible on the keyboard.So, what I did after trying this Razer keyboard for a couple days is order a full-size Corsair K55 RGB gaming membrane keyboard with dedicated media buttons as well to see which one I respond to better.Overall, I think you will enjoy this gaming keyboard (for the price) if you have modest expectations and don’t require lots of features as on many other, more expensive gaming keyboards that I have read about before opting for this one.

"twills805","2.0 out of 5 stars","Get what you pay for","Sorry, but this is rubbish and not a gaming keyboard in any sense. The price for the brand seemed too good to be true and it was.The first one that arrived, the ""D"" key started rubbing off within the first day. It was returned and replaced at no cost to myself - which is a positive.But after a few weeks the same thing has happened again, along with left Shift key.Had a look on their website, and no replacement keycaps are available in the UK. US and Canada only!Have also noticed on more than one occasion the so called anti-ghosting not working - you are unable to press 3 keys at once..!Will put away in a drawer and use as a backup.
